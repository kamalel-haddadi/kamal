    summary: "A couple of years ago, I was doing what many would consider a \"stable\" career path. I was a media buyer in Tangier, Morocco, spending my days optimizing ad campaigns and chasing conversion rates. From the outside, it probably looked like I had it figured out – steady work, decent pay, clear career trajectory. What others didn't see were the quiet moments of frustration that kept building up inside me.",
